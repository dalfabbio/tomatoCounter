<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project is the final assignement of the JavaScript Basic course of [Start To Impact University]. The task was simple: build a counter with javascript.

Few requirements:
* Just JavaScript allowed, not Jquery neither frameworks (React, Angular, Vue...);
* The +/- buttons and the counter value have to be implemented through JavaScript.

Any add ons functionality welcomed!

### What's the deal with a tomato counter?
<a name="#what-is-the-deal-with-a-tomato-counter"></a>
The idea is to support anyone who might use *[the pomodoro tecnique]* to focus. This tecnique is a way to improve the ability to focus on a task, by drawing a tomato every 25 minutes of work. \
But what if I don't have paper or a pen? Here it comes *The marvellous tomato counter*, that draws the tomatoes for you!\
You can use it to keep track of how long you focused on a work you want(or must) do.

## Functionalities
With the Marvellous Tomato Counter you can:
* Simply keep count of your tomatoes manually with the counter, adding tomatoes to the screen;
* Set a number of tomatoes to start with, then add more with the counter;
* Set up a stopwatch that every 25 minutes add a tomato for you*. \
*\* For debugging reasons the stowatch function right now is set to add a tomato every second.*

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Future improvements
* Add an animation when a tomato is added;
* Add a sound everytime a tomato is added using the stopwatch: this way you do not need to switch to the tomato counter tab to see how much time has passed;
* Add a "save your progress" functionality, allowing to know how much time you are investing on a single task;
* Add to the stopwatch the possibility to toggle "break time!" which will make a sound when 25 minutes has passed, pause the stopwatch, and make another sound when 5 minutes has passed and it's time to go back to work.
